  ### Modular Industrial Air Filtration Solutions for Military and Defense
  Manufacturing


  Duroair modular industrial air filtration systems for military and defense brings clean air to each rapid-moving manufacturing operation.  With a retractable [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) and vented or non-vented air filtration, each system can be engineered to accommodate large components for jets, MRAPs, or submarines, creating a cost-effective alternative to conventional systems.


  Military and defense OEM clean air solutions include:


  * **Repair and refinishing booths** with our [DuroCap™](/products/durocap), with [Taper Daft Airflow](/products/taper-draft-airflow-technology) technology that captures 99.4% of toxic dust from sanding and grinding tasks, often generated while working on paint from MRAPs

  * **Climate-controlled painting and coating rooms** in portable, retractable enclosures with [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) non-vented air filtration that easily move with grinding, painting, or sanding assignments and collect 100 percent of hexavalent chromium contaminants 

  * **Prototyping clean air booths** with retractable enclosures for overhead crane access and non-vented air filtration for self-contained security

  * **Special anterooms with HEPA filtration** designed to contain, capture, and collect particulates as operators move from inside a retractable enclosure to the general shop environment

  * **Down draft worktables** engineered to capture and collect contaminates generated while prepping, sanding, grinding, or cutting
