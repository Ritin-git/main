### How It Works

The DuroClean™ exhaust system filters air to an ISO 6 standard to create [portable clean rooms](/solutions/clean-rooms/) or isolation rooms for mechanical assembly, [additive manufacturing](/solutions/additive-manufacturing/), R&D, and other processes requiring a clean environment. Combined with our DuroRoom retractable enclosure, the DuroClean engineered exhaust system becomes a flexible, cost-effective solution for on-demand clean rooms and isolation rooms wherever and whenever they are needed.
