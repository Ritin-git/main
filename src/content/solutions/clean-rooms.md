    Ensuring quality control while balancing long-term construction with
    short-term cutting, welding, or surface prep and spraying tasks is an
    ongoing logistical challenge. Navigating these cellular workflows is
    critical
    for [aerospace](https://www.duroair.com/industries/aerospace-aviation) OEMs, [ship
    and boat manufacturers](https://www.duroair.com/industries/marine), and for
    operations conducting prototyping and R&D.


    How do you cost-effectively isolate manufacturing processes to keep damaging elements out and clean air around each workpiece?

  [Benefits](https://www.duroair.com/blog/21-ways-a-retractable-clean-air-enclosure-solves-problems)
  of Duroair’s custom portable clean room design includes:


  * Increased workflow efficiency for stop-and-start R&D processes

  * Reduced material handling by not having to transport large workpieces to a dedicated clean air space

  * Eliminated need for expensive equipment and installation for air make-up

  * Laminar or turbulent airflow as required

  * Unsurpassed control of isolated work environments, including pressure (positive or negative), humidity, and temperature air flow patterns, and harmful dust particulates and gaseous contaminants

  ### Bring Compliant Clean Air to On-Demand Work Spaces


  Duroair’s retractable clean rooms create clean air environments wherever they are needed. We combine our [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom)  retractable enclosure with our DuroClean™  engineered exhaust system into one flexible, cost-effective solution for portable clean rooms and isolation rooms.


  Duroair modular clean rooms can be placed anywhere in a manufacturing facility without having to install supplementary ductwork — or pay for ongoing air make-up costs. Our portable, retractable enclosures with non-vented air filtration can be engineered for large or small self-contained work environments, wherever and whenever needed. 


  Whether isolating a manufacturing process from the larger work environment (negative pressure) or protecting a process from contamination (positive pressure), our [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) and engineered filtration systems help guarantee worker safety from toxic dust and fumes, while reducing operating expenses and increasing productivity.
