  intro_desc: From laser and plasma cutting to grinding and sanding, working with
    metals can produce a toxic cloud of oil mist, fine particulate dust, and
    fumes that not only threaten your machinery and electronics, but endanger
    your most valuable assets – your employees. There’s also the risk of fines
    if your facility doesn’t walk the compliance talk when it comes to OSHA’s
    permissible exposure limits (PELs).

  Duroair’s industrial dust collector and filtration solutions for metal cutting
  provide:


  * Increased flexibility for full use of overhead cranes for moving large workpieces

  * Cost-effective, low-volume workflow efficiency in tandem with larger projects

  * Improved cellular capability for R&D for metal fabrication prototyping and validation

  * Reduced construction and maintenance costs associated with facility-wide HVAC systems and on-going makeup air processes

  * Compliant, clean air per NFPA, OSHA, UL, and EPA requirements, via six-stage, non-vented filtration that captures 100 percent of airborne particulates and eliminates chemicals and vapors
